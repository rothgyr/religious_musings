# Summary
_We are children of God. We are destined to become like him. God's plan
for us is to follow the same ladder he climbed, per King Follett Sermon.
The whole journey of learning to become like him is taken step by step,
rung by rung, covenant by covenant, and grace for grace. In short, being
"saved" is not an event. It is a process, and a glorious, fulfilling
journey. Or in other words, salvation has no end._
