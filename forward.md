In recent conversations with family - most of whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter Day Saints - questions came up, that made me look for answers.

As I studied and looked for primary sources, I found that many things we think we are 
taught, are not actually taught. We apparently assume a lot of things, and very often.

I'm a common member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and in these
writings, I reference Canonized and non Canonized works from said church's culture. I speak 
for no one, and no organization, above all, I want to emphasize that _this is a study, not a 
treatise_. 

Most scripture isn't God dictating a legal constitution. It's a collection of 
thoughts, happenings, musings, visions, revelations, and stories, and that a reader should 
avoid citing things against their original context and intended meanings.

Ask God for answers.
