## Scriptures of Note From Doctrine & Covenants Section 88

14 Now, verily I say unto you, that through the redemption which is made for you is
brought to pass the resurrection from the dead. 

15 And the spirit and the body are the soul of man.

16 And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul. 

17 And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, in whose
bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it.

20 That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever and ever; for, for
this intent was [the celestial kingdom] made and created, and for this intent are they 
sanctified.

21 And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you, even the
law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that
of a telestial kingdom.

22 For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial
glory.

23 And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial
glory.

24 And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory;
therefore he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. Therefore he must abide a kingdom which
is not a kingdom of glory.

25 And again, verily I say unto you, the earth abideth the law of a celestial kingdom, for
it filleth the measure of its creation, and transgresseth not the law—

26 Wherefore, it shall be sanctified; yea, notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be
quickened again, and shall abide the power by which it is quickened, and the righteous
shall inherit it.

[...]

28 They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was a natural
body; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your
bodies are quickened.

29 Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then receive of the
same, even a fulness.

30 And they who are quickened by a portion of the terrestrial glory shall then receive of
the same, even a fulness.

31 And also they who are quickened by a portion of the telestial glory shall then receive
of the same, even a fulness.

32 And they who remain shall also be quickened; nevertheless, they shall return again to
their own place, to enjoy that which they are willing to receive, because they were not
willing to enjoy that which they might have received.

[...]

38 And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also
and conditions.

39 All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.

[...]

95 And there shall be silence in heaven for the space of half an hour; and immediately
after shall the curtain of heaven be unfolded, as a scroll is unfolded after it is rolled
up, and the face of the Lord shall be unveiled;

96 And the saints that are upon the earth, who are alive, shall be quickened and be caught
up to meet him.

97 And they who have slept in their graves shall come forth, for their graves shall be
opened; and they also shall be caught up to meet him in the midst of the pillar of heaven—

98 They are Christ’s, the first fruits, they who shall descend with him first, and they
who are on the earth and in their graves, who are first caught up to meet him; and all
this by the voice of the sounding of the trump of the angel of God.
``` 
These are those of the Celestial resurrection - those who rise in the morning of the 
first resurrection. See D&C 76:50-70. "These are they whose bodies are celestial"
```

99 And after this another angel shall sound, which is the second trump; and then cometh
the redemption of those who are Christ’s at his coming; who have received their part in
that prison which is prepared for them, that they might receive the gospel, and be judged
according to men in the flesh.

``` 
This appears to be terrestrial beings, and those who repent after having passed away. 
It seems unclear when this trump will sound. I assume 

D&C 138:29-34:
29 And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I perceived
that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the
truth, to teach them;

(telestial beings would not be ministered to by the savior, but by angels speaking 
through the power of the Holy Ghost 2 NE 32:3)

30 But behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed messengers,
clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the
gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel
preached to the dead.
31 And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim
liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all who would repent of their sins and receive
the gospel.
32 Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the
truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets.
33 These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of
sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands,
34 And all other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify
themselves that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in
the spirit.
[...]
58 The dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordiances of the 
house of God, 
59 And after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are washed clean, 
shall receive a reward according to their works, for they are heirs of salvation.
```

100 And again, another trump shall sound, which is the third trump; and then come the
spirits of men who are to be judged, and are found under condemnation;

101 And these are the rest of the dead; and they live not again until the thousand years
are ended, neither again, until the end of the earth.

``` 
My _assumption_ here is that these are those who repent, but did not live according to a 
higher law, and must pay for their broken laws before being able to assume a kingdom 
of a higher law - ie people who didn't live chaste lives abode not the law of chastity,
 wouldn't be able to be quickened by a terrestrial glory until they were "capable" of 
 living the laws of a terrestrial kingdom, likewise the celestial and the law of 
 consecration.
```

``` 
"Until the thousand years are ended" - see 88:110. It appears that these are telestial 
beings, who are not resurrected, or are not redeeemd (see 88:16) until the end of the 
resurrection - they are not resurrected until the end of the world. I think "Thousand 
years" is likely figurative; a period of missionary work until Jesus' work of 
redemption is accomplished:

76:106 These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of Almighty God, 
until the fulness of times, when Christ shall have subdued all enemies under his feet, 
and shall have perfected his work;

76:107 When he shall deliver up the kingdom, and present it unto the Father, spotless...
```

102 And another trump shall sound, which is the fourth trump, saying: There are found
among those who are to remain until that great and last day, even the end, who shall
remain filthy still.

```
I must assume sons of perdition here, see 88:32
```

[More angels sounding trumps until the end]

106 And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is
finished; it is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press alone, even
the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.

107 And then shall the angels be crowned with the glory of his might, and the saints shall be
filled with his glory, and receive their inheritance and be made equal with him.

108 And then shall the first angel again sound his trump in the ears of all living, and
reveal the secret acts of men, and the mighty works of God in the first thousand years.

109 And then shall the second angel sound his trump, and reveal the secret acts of men,
and the thoughts and intents of their hearts, and the mighty works of God in the second
thousand years —

110 And so on, until the seventh angel shall sound his trump; and he shall stand forth
upon the land and upon the sea, and swear in the name of him who sitteth upon the throne,
that there shall be time no longer; and Satan shall be bound, that old serpent, who is
called the devil, and shall not be loosed for the space of a thousand years.

111 And then he shall be loosed for a little season, that he may gather together his
armies.

112 And Michael, the seventh angel, even the archangel, shall gather together his armies,
even the hosts of heaven.

113 And the devil shall gather together his armies; even the hosts of hell, and shall come
up to battle against Michael and his armies.

114 And then cometh the battle of the great God; and the devil and his armies shall be
cast away into their own place, that they shall not have power over the saints any more at
all.

115 For Michael shall fight their battles, and shall overcome him who seeketh the throne
of him who sitteth upon the throne, even the Lamb.

116 This is the glory of God, and the sanctified; and they shall not any more see death.


We go through the endowment, having been washed and annointed, set apart to _become_ 
priests and priestesses at a later time, when we shall be called up and made to be 
such. The work is there, it is up to us to accept it and live laws worthy or such a 
reception.

Sealing the dead plays a similar role. Children of the covenant have such kingdoms and 
priesthoods waiting for them, should they live true and faithful to their covenants 
they shall be given by ministering angels. 

## Lorenzo Dow Young's Vision

In a moment, I was out of my body and fully conscious of the change. I was sensible that I
had passed through what we call death. I felt and acted as naturally as I had done in the
body, with all my sensations as complete without as with it.

At once a heavenly guide was by my side dressed in the purest white.

For a short time I remained in the room where lay my body. My sister Fanny, who was living
with me, and my wife, were weeping bitterly over my death. I sympathized with and desired
to comfort them in their grief. I realized I was under the direction of the man who was by
me, and begged of him the privilege of speaking to them. He replied that he could not
grant it. My guide, for so I will call him, said “Now let us go.

Space seemed annihilated. Apparently we went up and almost instantly were in another
world, of the magnitude of which I formed no conception. It was filled with innumerable
hosts of beings as naturally human as those among whom I had lived.

All sorts of people were intermingled, and some of them I recognized as acquaintances in
the world I had just left. My guide informed me that they had not yet arrived at their
final abiding place. Their surroundings and appearance indicated they were in a state of
expectancy, and anxiously awaiting some event of considerable importance to them.

`SPIRIT WORLD^^?`

Going on from this place my guide said, “I will now show you the condition of the damned.”
Pointing with his hand he said, “Look.”

I looked down a distance which to me appeared incomprehensible, and gazed on a vast region
filled with multitudes of intelligences. I saw every thing with the most minute
distinctness, and the vast multitudes of people seemed extremely miserable. “These,” said
my guide, “are they who have rejected the means of salvation that were placed within their
reach, and in that way have brought upon themselves the condemnation you behold.

The expression of the countenances of these sufferers was clear and distinct, and conveyed
to me a consciousness that no one but themselves were to blame for their forlorn
condition. This scene affected me so much that I could not refrain from weeping.

`HELL? Obviously not a place of glory, people who rejected the means of salvation, who 
did not receive the gospel, whether in this like, or the next?`

Again my guide said, ‘Now let us go.’

In a moment we were at the gate of a beautiful city, which was opened, and we passed in. I
cannot describe its beauty and grandeur. It was clothed in the purest light I had ever
beheld, brilliant but not glaring nor unpleasant.

`Telestial glory?`

My guide rather hurried me on through this place to another still higher, but connected
with it. It was still more beautiful and glorious than what I had seen, with an extent and
magnificence incomprehensible to me.

`Terrestrial glory?`

My guide rather hurried me on through this place to another still higher, but connected
with it. It was still more beautiful and glorious than what I had seen, with an extent and
magnificence incomprehensible to me.

`Celestial glory?`

Said my guide, ‘That is where God resides.’

He permitted me to enter this glorious city but a short distance and, without speaking,
motioned that we would retrace our steps.

We were soon in the adjoining (`terrestrial?`) city, where I met my mother and a sister
who died when six or seven years old. These I recognized at once. After mingling with the
pure and happy beings of this place a short time, my guide again said, “Let us go.

When we were through the gate by which we had entered the city, my guide said, “Now we
will return.”

I could distinctly see the world from which we started, but at a vast distance below us.
It looked cloudy and dark. I was filled with sadness, I might say horror, at the idea of
returning there, for at first, I had hoped to stay in that heavenly place I had so long
desired to see. Up to this time the thought had not occurred to me that I should be
required to return.

I pleaded with my guide to let me remain. He replied that I must return and take my body,
for I was only permitted to visit these heavenly cities before I had filled my mission in
yonder world. He promised me if I was faithful to the grace of God which would be imparted
to me, if I would bear a faithful testimony to the inhabitants of the earth of a
sacrificed and risen Savior and of His atonement for man, in a little time I should be
permitted to return and remain.

To me the circumstances, the words, and the spirit that accompanied them were real and I
was comforted and inspired with faith. I accepted the great mission that was then placed
upon me and have never ceased to realize its responsibilities.

We returned to my house where I found my body, apparently dressed for burial. With great
reluctance I took possession of it to resume the avocations of life and endeavor to fill
the mission I had received. I awoke and found myself in bed, where I lay and meditated the
remainder of the night on what had been shown me.

Call it a dream, a vision, or what I may, it was as real to every sense of my being as
anything I have passed through. The memory of this [vision] is still clear and distinct,
after the lapse of over fifty years with their many changes.

From that time, although belonging to no church, the spirit was with me to testify to the
sufferings and atonement of the Savior. As I had opportunity I exhorted the people in
public and in private to exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, to repent of their sins
and live lives of righteousness and good works.
