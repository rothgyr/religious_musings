## Why is Salvation Even Needed?

### The Fall
It doesn't matter if you believe Adam and Eve saw a snake. It doesn't matter if 
you believe it was an apple. The narrative is all that matters. They were tempted, 
and they gave in, sparking the need to bring them back on the path, and to give them 
hope while in their tribulations. A reason behind their sufferings.

## Jesus' Reconciliation Between us and the Father

## What Is Salvation
In broad terms, salvation is redemption from the Fall of Adam and Eve - to be brought 
back into the presence of God the Eternal Father through the sufferings and merits 
of Jesus Christ, and the terms and conditions set by Him, and Him alone.

## Jesus' Terms and Conditions
Follow Him. 

How we follow Him has been the source of millenia of discussion, arguments, divisions, 
and even wars.

Let me simplify it by stating that only Jesus can tell you how to follow Him. Your 
answers are your own journey, and salvation is only attainable through revelation. When 
Nephi asked his brothers if they had asked God for answers, they said He didn't talk 
to them. Nephi responded with some pretty damning questions. 

Ask God. When you think about it, it's ridiculous that you should put your 
salvation in another person's hands and pass on your agency to someone else. "Come 
unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and 
trembling before him."
