# Summary

_We are children of God. We are destined to become like him. God's plan for us is to
follow the same ladder he climbed, per King Follett Sermon. The whole journey of learning
to become like him is taken step by step, rung by rung, covenant by covenant, and grace
for grace. In short, being
"saved" is not an event. It is a process, and a glorious, fulfilling journey. Or in other
words, salvation has no end._

### What is Spirit? What is the Destiny of God's Children?

In the King Follet Sermon by Joseph Smith
([part 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/04/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng)
, [part 2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/05/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng))
, he says that "The mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co-equal co-eternal
with God himself," and that our spirits were not created -- that "God never had the power
to create the spirit of man at all." He states also that "All the minds and spirits that
God ever sent into the world are susceptible of enlargement."

One of Joseph Smith's common themes in teaching was that knowledge was the key to
salvation:

```
18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with 
us in the resurrection.

19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his 
diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world 
to come.
``` 

(D&C 130:18-19)

In the King Follett discourse, Smith continues to teach that God set up a system to help
us grow, and become more like Him:

```
God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more
intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to
advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to
advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences,
that they may be exalted with Himself, so that they might have one glory upon another[.]
```

Joseph Smith says that Jesus will take His Father's Throne, and His Father will gain a
higher one:

```
What did Jesus do? Why, I do the things I saw my Father do when worlds came rolling into
existence. My Father worked out His kingdom with fear and trembling, and I must do the
same; and when I get my kingdom, I shall present it to My Father, so that He may obtain
kingdom upon kingdom, and it will exalt Him in glory. He will then take a higher
exaltation, and I will take His place, and thereby become exalted myself. So that Jesus
treads in the tracks of His Father, and inherits what God did before; and God is thus
glorified and exalted in the salvation and exaltation of all His children.
```

Smith then describes our spirits' eternal progression as a ladder, that we move up one
rung at a time, learning "principles of exaltation". He says

```
"But it will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have
learned them. It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to
learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave."
```

Understanding our ideal destiny is something usually veiled in metaphor, speculation, and
mystery. The scriptures talk about the ending state of the righteous with descriptions
of "mansions", "glory", a "city made of gold", a "sea of glass", etc., but the idea of
what we do there is rarely discussed. Do we play harps of gold and praise god forever and
ever?

Francine Bennion, a former board member for the Young Women and Relief Society in the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, relates a story from teaching at BYU where
she challenged her students' views on "the celstial kingdom", and it's perfection - that
there will be no problems. In their words, “Well, for one thing, everyone will be—happy.
There won’t be any unkindness. No one there will be rejected or abused, or laughed at, or
ignored.”

She challenged them, saying, “Are you suggesting that God experiences none of these things
now?”

She then refers to our preexistence, and says "I doubt there was a never-never land where
we could have been happy children without responsibility forever. Apparently there was a
point at which we had to grow up or choose not to. Our scriptures suggest that there were
unavoidable decisions to be made consciously and responsibly by all inhabitants in the
premortal council, as in Eden."

"...The wonder is that Lucifer’s intended universe is exactly the universe many now
attribute to God, or want from him. God offered a profoundly different possibility, that
with his help we meet and create reality as individuals in a universe of law and personal
agency, and ultimately choose who we want to be, choosing to become more like himself if
that is what we want(.)" [(source)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/church-historians-press/at-the-pulpit/part-4/chapter-43?lang=eng)

As I believe that I cannot keep my children from growing up, from having to endure
puberty, starting a life of their own, etc., without destroying their futures, I also
believe that God could not prevent us from progressing either - that instead he embraces
progress, for "This is my work and my glory; to bring to pass the immortality and eternal
life of man."
[Moses 1:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng)

By this logic, it seems contrary to God's nature and ours, that we should ever be halted
in progressing toward His glory, so long as we follow Jesus' plan. There is ample proof
that this is only denied to those who fight his plan, who reject Jesus and upon whom the
blood of the prophets is found. All else "shall bow the knee, and every tongue shall
confess to him who sits upon the throne forever and
ever;" [D&C 76:110](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng)

### Thesis 
**The journey to the Celestial Kingdom is the destiny of all mankind,
not just the proverbial "righteous". It is a function of time within eternity, and 
eventual choice.**
