# Resurrection, the Kingdoms of Glory, and Work for the Dead/Sinners

## Hypothesis

All men are saved eventually - the Second Resurrection allows for all those except who
have committed the unpardonable sin (D&C 130: 27), to have an opportunity to attain
the celestial kingdom.

## Agenda

### Central Question

Everything in this body should revolve around the central question of "Are we
resurrected into kingdoms, and can we progress from kingdom to kingdom?"

In this document, we will

1. define spirits, spiritual progress, agency, and the destiny of mankind
2. define kingdoms of glory
3. evaluate D&C 76, the questions it answers, and the two resurrections
4. differentiate between the ideas of permanent kingdoms and
   celestial/terrestrial/telestial bodies
5. discuss the role of the ordination to the Melchizidek priesthood via ordinance
   (temple ordinances)
6. discuss the role of "obedience" and "commandments" in this life
7. define salvation and evaluate Jesus' teachings on the matter
8. discuss the role of priests in helping telestial bodies to achieve higher glory

### What is Spirit? What is the Destiny of God's Children?
In the King Follet Sermon (hereafter called KFS) by Joseph Smith
([part 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/04/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng)
, [part 2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/05/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng))
,
Joseph Smith says that "The mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co-equal
[co-eternal] with God himself," and that our spirits were not created, and that "God
never had the power to create the spirit of man at all." He states also that "All the
minds and spirits that God ever sent into the world are susceptible of enlargement."

Futher, "God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was
more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to
advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to
advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences,
that they may be exalted with Himself, so that they might have one glory upon another[.]"

Joseph Smith, in the KFS, says that Jesus will take His Father's Throne, and His
Father will gain a higher one: "What did Jesus do? Why, I do the things I saw my Father do
when worlds came rolling into existence. My Father worked out His kingdom with fear and
trembling, and I must do the same; and when I get my kingdom, I shall present it to My
Father, so that He may obtain kingdom upon kingdom, and it will exalt Him in glory. _He
will then take a higher exaltation, and I will take His place, and thereby become exalted
myself. So that Jesus treads in the tracks of His Father, and inherits what God did
before_; and God is thus glorified and exalted in the salvation and exaltation of all His
children." (emphasis added)

Smith then discribes our spirits' eternal progression as a ladder, that we move up one
rung at a time, learning "principles of exaltation". He says that "But it will be a great
while after you have passed through the veil before you will have learned them. It is not
all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our salvation and
exaltation even beyond the grave."

Francine Bennion relates a story from teaching at BYU where she challenged her
students' views on "the celstial kingdom", and it's perfection - that there will be no
problems. In their words, “Well, for one thing, everyone will be—happy. There won’t be any
unkindness. No one there will be rejected or abused, or laughed at, or ignored.”

She challenged them, saying, “Are you suggesting that God experiences none of these
things now?”

She then refers to our preexistence, and says "I doubt there was a never-never land where
we could have been happy children without responsibility forever. Apparently there was a
point at which we had to grow up or choose not to. Our scriptures suggest that there were
unavoidable decisions to be made consciously and responsibly by all inhabitants in the
premortal council, as in Eden."

"...The wonder is that Lucifer’s intended universe is exactly the universe many now
attribute to God, or want from him. God offered a profoundly different possibility,
that with his help we meet and create reality as individuals in a universe of law and
personal agency, and ultimately choose who we want to be, choosing to become more
like himself if that is what we want(.)"

As I cannot keep my children from growing up, from having to endure puberty, starting
a life of their own, etc., without destroying their futures, I believe that God could
not prevent us from progressing either - that instead he embraces progress, for "This
is my work and my glory; to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."
[Moses 1:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng)

By this logic, it seems contrary to God's nature and ours, that we should ever be
halted in progressing toward His glory, so long as we follow Jesus' plan. There is
ample proof that this is only denied to those who fight his plan, who reject Jesus and
upon whom the blood of the prophets is found. All else "shall bow the knee, and
every tongue shall confess to him who sits upon the throne forever and ever;" [D&C 
76:110](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng)

We'll address this topic at a later time in this article.

### St John 5:29 and the Resurrections of the Just and Unjust, not the Saved and Damned
Many people in the Restored Church of Jesus Christ view D&C 76 as a revelation 
regarding "kingdoms of glory". Reading it in context shows a different view.

As Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith were translating the Bible together, they noted the 
difference between what is found in the King James version of the bible, where it 
states in St John 5:29:

```
And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and 
they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
```

To their interest, it changed from "resurrection of life" and "resurrection of 
damnation", to the following: 

```
And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of
the just; and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

The difference between these verses is not apparent by reading D&C 76 alone, you have 
to go to the KJV Bible and actually read the comparison.

From there, they were shown the devil, his minions, and those who are convinced by him 
to fight against God's plan. (v30-38) 

It says in v39 that the rest of God's children shall be resurrected. It goes on to 
extol the saving work of Jesus, and goes back to say that Jesus saves all except those 
followers of the devil, and they are shown their suffering until v50. 

v50 begins their discourse on the Gospel of Christ as it affects those who come forth 
in the resurrection of the just (the first resurrection). It states that those who are 
brought forth in the First Resurrection are those who have received the ordinances of 
the Melchizidek Priesthood (temple ordiances) and are washed clean with the blood of 
Jesus. These are those who partake of the first resurrection.

In v71, we move on to "terrestrial" glory:

```
And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of 
the terrestrial, whose glory differs... [@JA: from that of the celestial]
```

It then tells who will have this glory. This is covered at length in church discourse, 
and I will not cover it here.

We then go to those who are brought forth in the second resurrection, or resurrection of 
the unjust. These are the telestial people. 

```
85 These are they who shall not be redeemed from the devil until the last resurrection, 
until the Lord, even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work.

86 These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy 
Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial;

87 And the terrestrial through the ministration of the celestial.

88 And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed 
to minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them; for 
they shall be heirs of salvation.
```

It's worth noting here that there is no specific mention of which resurrection the 
terrestrials will be part of. Later on in v98-102 it states specifically that the 
telestials 

```
...are they who will not be gathered with the saints, to be caught up unto the church of 
the Firstborn, and received into the cloud.
```

I assume here that this event where the faithful are received into the cloud refers to 
either the second coming of the Lord. I haven't done any primary research into that, 
so take it as you will. I can however, say that it kind of infers that any of the 
terrestrial glory who accept the `the gospel, [...] the testimony of Jesus, 
[...] the prophets, [and] the everlasting covenant` will be part of the first 
resurrection? This will require some further study to say with any surety.

v109 - v112 speak of the state of the telestials after Christ finishes his work (end 
of all things):

```
109 But behold, and lo, we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the telestial world, 
that they were as innumerable as the stars in the firmament of heaven, or as the sand 
upon the seashore;

110 And heard the voice of the Lord saying: These all shall bow the knee, and every 
tongue shall confess to him who sits upon the throne forever and ever;

111 For they shall be judged according to their works, and every man shall receive 
according to his own works, his own dominion, in the mansions which are prepared;

112 And they shall be servants of the Most High; but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds without end.
```

The most important takeaways in this section, are not that there are kingdoms of glory.
This section answers the question of "when will the just and unjust be resurrected?". 
All the information in this section of the Doctrine and Covenants are given under the 
context of this question, not of what happens after final judgement, or even what 
happens after resurrection.

### Kingdoms vs Bodies

`diagram a`

An alternate way of looking at things is that
* judgement is not a one time event that occurs for all spirits at one time, just as
  the first resurrection is ongoing, and the second will be (as far as I can tell) a
  one time event


![](https://www.eternalroundring.com/uploads/1/2/1/2/121243642/linear-image-with-christ_orig.jpg)
`diagram b`


Circles & Squares leads us to believe that final judgement is pronounced before
resurrection, and our end is fixed. I challenge this idea by looking at the wording in
D&C 76.

### The Celestial Journey to Higher Kingdoms

Vision listed in the Gate of Heaven about the kingdoms.

Note the ministry of angels, D&C 138, Mor 7, etc. about angels.

These angels are supposed to help those in a telestial world to be introduced into the
terrestrial world based on obeying laws with covenants, and being given the means to
pass through the dangers of the journey to higher kingdoms.

### We are Ministering Angels

# Rough Draft
***
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, we look to Doctrine & Covenants
Section 76 as a source of truth regarding "Kingdoms of Glory". It is also common to
teach the plan of salvation using diagram `a`, where we describe the spirit world and
degrees of glory as being divided by resurrection and judgement.

As of writing this paper, I don't know of any place that says where judgement actually
happens in this timeline - is it upon death, where we are sent to torment or peace? Is
it after the _second_ resurrection? These questions do not appear to have answers
within short reach and require more digging.

Discuss the questions that D&C 76 was answered. Make clear that it does not refer to
being resurrected into kingdoms, as is taught in the Cirlces and Squares format. It is
entirely possible that these glories are present in the sprit world, rather than
simply Spirit Prison and Spirit Paradise.

In fact, the terms Sprit Paradise and Spirit Prison are not derrived from scriptural
sources, and cannot be traced easily. For the sake of our arguments, we will simply
suspend their existence as non doctrinal at all.

D&C 130:19

```
And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which
is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy
Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the
keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them—Ye shall come forth in the first
resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and
shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and
depths—then shall it be written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder
whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder
whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my
servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force
when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are
set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their
heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.
```

Reworded: If two people are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise and by a Sealer, they
will either come forth in the first or second resurrection, and inherit
[sealing blessings], if you commit no murder/don't stone the prophets.

Verse 26 further clarifies

```
26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they
are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she
shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and
all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder wherein they shed innocent blood,
yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but
they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan
unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.
```

Takeaways: People can leave the church and still be saved. It will just be in the
second resurrection - the resurrection of the unjust and sinners.

D&C 76:50+ states that the resurrection of the just has all those who recieved the
priesthood (Temple ordinances)

Describes those of the church of the firstborn, those who stayed faithful, those who
are celestial - first resurrection.

70: `These are they whose bodies are celestial`

After that, we get a description of those who are Terrestrial. Note that it is a
description - as of verse 80 we don't have anything about which resurrection, nor that
their bodies are even resurrected in this state.

85: Telestial persons are not redeemed `until the last resurrection, until the Lord,
even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work`.

```
86 These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy
Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial;

87 And the terrestrial through the ministration of the celestial.

88 And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to
minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them; for they shall
be heirs of salvation.
```

But what is the `eternal world`? The spirit world? The resurrected world? As of v88,
this question remains unanswered.

Also of note: Jesus did not minister to the damned, but sent "angels" (think Peter,
James and John) to the damned to preach the gospel (D&C 138:29-31)

D&C 130 states that what we attain to in this life gives us the more advantage - or in
King Follet Sermon terms - a higher rung in the ladder, a rung that will be filled
later by people they help up.

From D&C 130:

```
15 For while we were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us,
we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as
follows—

16 Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall hear the voice of
the Son of Man:

17 And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and
they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

At no time does it say that we are resurrected to these states, merely which groups
shall have part in the first resurrection (of the just) and those of the second
resurrection (of the unjust).

The King Follet sermon concludes with words of rejoicing, indicating that those who
are passed in the faith, are in celestial glory:

``` 
...and those who have died in the faith are now in the celestial kingdom of God. And 
hence is the glory of the sun.

You mourners have occasion to rejoice, speaking of the death of Elder King Follett; for
your husband and father is gone to wait until the resurrection of the dead—until the
perfection of the remainder; for at the resurrection your friend will rise in perfect
felicity and go to celestial glory, while many must wait myriads of years before they can
receive the like blessings; and your expectations and hopes are far above what man can
conceive; for why has God revealed it to us?
```

The entirety of of section 76 was given in response to their wonder at translating this:

```
29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
```

To this:

```
And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

Namely, that those who did not repent in this life will pay prices for their sins, but
ultimately be saved and brought forth in the second resurrection.

## Conclusion/Thesis
