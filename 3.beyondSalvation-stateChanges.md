## Common Paradigm of the Restored Church in the Early 21st Century
### Common Perceptions in the Church

As of 2023, I believe it is commonly taught that we were with God, we came here to gain
bodies and experience, and that when we die we go to either Spirit Prison or Spirit
Paradise, and finally after a Final Judgement, we go to one of three kingdoms of Glory.
Narrowing it down for time's sake - those who made covenants go to the Celestial, those
who didn't but were still good to the Terrestrial, and the unrighteous and unbelieving to
the Telestial.

My own dad taught this to us in 12 year old sunday school, again and again for months, 
using the following diagram:

`diagram a`

My position in this book is that we ought to largely rearrange the diagram along these 
lines:

`diagram b`

This goes against common perceptions in the church, but not against any actual 
doctrine. 

When studying any science, topic, hobby, or in this case, religious doctrine,
I give strong credence to Primary Sources. People or statements based in actual 
experience, practice, learning, or revelation, in the case of religion. If something 
is taught in Sunday School, over a pulpit, or anywhere else in church, I ask myself 
where that information came from. Is it _actually_ truth, or just the philosophies of 
men, mingled with scripture?

For example - when church standards for grooming were updated around the turn of the
century to discourage multiple ear piercings for women or getting tattoos, a lot of people
cited 1 Corinthians 6:19, stating that our bodies are temples, and that changing your
bodies was like defacing the temple.

Taken out of context, yes, that would seem to make sense, but taking the whole 
scripture with its context, it's clear that it's referring to the body of Christ, of 
which we are all members. In other words, this teaching is not based in truth, but is 
just an anecdotal saying.

Yet again, I have seen people speak _over the pulpit at General Conference_, citing 
Jesus' words in ST John 5:39 as reason to study scriptures:

```
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
testify of me.
```
[LeGrand Richards, 1980](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak?lang=eng&id=p2-p3#p2)

But the phrase "for in them ye think ye have eternal life" was mocking the pharisees, 
and even damning them. Cited out of context, this scripture can sound like we get 
closer to Jesus by reading scriptures, and while this is undoubtedly true, it's not 
the whole truth. 

The problem lies in that we repeat these secondary sources' words when teaching in 
church, and do so out of context, creating a cloud of would-be-truths around the 
actual truth, and obscure it.

Regarding "kingdoms of glory", I believe this has happened again and again, to the 
point that we have accepted many philosophies of men and half-truths as being both 
truth and canon.

### Context of Doctrine & Covenants 76
If I were to ask a typical well-read member of the church where we learn about 
kingdoms of glory, they'll almost certainly cite D&C 76 as being the revelation where 
Joseph Smith learned about the kingdoms of Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial glory.

In my recent studies, reading through 76 in the context of my thesis, I was shocked to 
learn that section 76 says _nothing_ about kingdoms. The entirety of section 76 was given
in response to Joseph Smith and Sydney Rigdon's wonder at translating this piece of the
original King James text:

```
And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and 
they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
```

To this newly translated piece:

```
And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; 
and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

It is entirely possible that the glories described in 76 are present in the Spirit 
World, rather than simply Spirit Prison and Spirit Paradise.

In fact, the terms "Spirit Paradise" and "Spirit Prison" are not derived from scriptural
sources, and cannot be traced easily. Possibly to Joseph F Smith's vision in D&C 138? But
for the sake of our arguments, we will simply suspend their existence as non-doctrinal 
for the time being, and that any reference to them is a Secondary Source and anecdotal.

### Resurrections and Glories - not Kingdoms

D&C 76:50+ states that the resurrection of the just has all those who received the
priesthood (Temple ordinances). It further describes those of the church of the firstborn,
those who stayed faithful, those who are celestial - first resurrection.

v70: `These are they whose bodies are celestial`

[D&C 76:50-70](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p50-p70#p50)

After that, we get a description of those who are Terrestrial. Note that it is a
description - as of verse 80 we don't have anything about which resurrection, nor that
their bodies are even resurrected in this state.

Telestial persons are
```
not redeemed from the devil until the last resurrection, 
until the Lord, even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work`.

86 These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy
Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial;

87 And the terrestrial through the ministration of the celestial.

88 And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to
minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them; for they shall
be heirs of salvation.
```
[D&C 76:81-85](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p50-p70#p50)

But what is the `eternal world` in v86? The spirit world? The resurrected world? As of
v88, this question remains unanswered.

Of special note, v88 states that the telestial beings receive the Holy Ghost through
messengers sent to a telestial world. Thinking again of the spirits in "prison", Jesus
did not minister to the damned during his 3 days in the Spirit World, but sent "angels"
(think Peter, James and John) to the damned to preach the gospel.

```
29 [...] I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient 
who had rejected the truth [...];

30 But [...] among the righteous, he [...] appointed messengers, [..] and commissioned 
them to go forth [...] to them that were in darkness [...]

31 And the chosen messengers went forth [...] to the captives who were bound, even unto
all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.
```
[D&C 138:29-31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng)

D&C 130 states that what we attain to in this life gives us the more advantage - or in
King Follet Sermon terms - a higher rung in the ladder, a rung that will be filled
later by people they help up.

[D&C 130:18-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p18-p21#p18)
[King Follett Sermon Part 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/04/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19)

Heralding back to the original question that Sydney Rigdon and Joseph Smith found 
while translating the Bible and consequently spurring this vision into existence:

```
17 And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and
they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

At no time does it say that we are resurrected to these states, merely which groups
shall have part in the first resurrection (of the just) and those of the second
resurrection (of the unjust).

The King Follet sermon concludes with words of rejoicing, indicating that those who
have passed on the faith, are in celestial glory:

``` 
...and those who have died in the faith are now in the celestial kingdom of God. And 
hence is the glory of the sun.

You mourners have occasion to rejoice, speaking of the death of Elder King Follett; for
your husband and father is gone to wait until the resurrection of the deadâ€”until the
perfection of the remainder; for at the resurrection your friend will rise in perfect
felicity and go to celestial glory, while many must wait myriads of years before they can
receive the like blessings; and your expectations and hopes are far above what man can
conceive; for why has God revealed it to us?
```

If an unresurrected can be in the celestial kingdom of God, what, when, and where is 
the Celestial Kingdom of God? What about Final Judgement? Is not that supposed to 
divide us into kingdoms, _after_ being resurrected?

Referring to `Diagram a`, which is commonly perceived as correct within the church, this 
certainly does not fit.

Let me describe a narrative that fits the concepts of degrees of glory outside the 
context of mortality, a two-sided spirit world, or of resurrection.
