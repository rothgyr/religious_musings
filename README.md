# Beyond Salvation

# 1: Intelligence, Spirit, and Creation

### What is Spirit? What is the Destiny of God's Children?

In the King Follet Sermon by Joseph Smith
([part 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/04/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng)
, [part 2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/05/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng))
, he says that "The mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co-equal co-eternal
with God himself," and that our spirits were not created -- that "God never had the power
to create the spirit of man at all." He states also that "All the minds and spirits that
God ever sent into the world are susceptible of enlargement."

One of Joseph Smith's common themes in teaching was that knowledge was the key to
salvation:

```
18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with 
us in the resurrection.

19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his 
diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world 
to come.
``` 

(D&C 130:18-19)

In the King Follett discourse, Smith continues to teach that God set up a system to help
us grow, and become more like Him:

```
God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more
intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to
advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to
advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences,
that they may be exalted with Himself, so that they might have one glory upon another[.]
```

Joseph Smith says that Jesus will take His Father's Throne, and His Father will gain a
higher one:

```
What did Jesus do? Why, I do the things I saw my Father do when worlds came rolling into
existence. My Father worked out His kingdom with fear and trembling, and I must do the
same; and when I get my kingdom, I shall present it to My Father, so that He may obtain
kingdom upon kingdom, and it will exalt Him in glory. He will then take a higher
exaltation, and I will take His place, and thereby become exalted myself. So that Jesus
treads in the tracks of His Father, and inherits what God did before; and God is thus
glorified and exalted in the salvation and exaltation of all His children.
```

Smith then describes our spirits' eternal progression as a ladder, that we move up one
rung at a time, learning "principles of exaltation". He says

```
"But it will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have
learned them. It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to
learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave."
```

Understanding our ideal destiny is something usually veiled in metaphor, speculation, and
mystery. The scriptures talk about the ending state of the righteous with descriptions
of "mansions", "glory", a "city made of gold", a "sea of glass", etc., but the idea of
what we do there is rarely discussed. Do we play harps of gold and praise god forever and
ever?

Francine Bennion, a former board member for the Young Women and Relief Society in the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, relates a story from teaching at BYU where
she challenged her students' views on "the celstial kingdom", and it's perfection - that
there will be no problems. In their words, “Well, for one thing, everyone will be—happy.
There won’t be any unkindness. No one there will be rejected or abused, or laughed at, or
ignored.”

She challenged them, saying, “Are you suggesting that God experiences none of these things
now?”

She then refers to our preexistence, and says "I doubt there was a never-never land where
we could have been happy children without responsibility forever. Apparently there was a
point at which we had to grow up or choose not to. Our scriptures suggest that there were
unavoidable decisions to be made consciously and responsibly by all inhabitants in the
premortal council, as in Eden."

"...The wonder is that Lucifer’s intended universe is exactly the universe many now
attribute to God, or want from him. God offered a profoundly different possibility, that
with his help we meet and create reality as individuals in a universe of law and personal
agency, and ultimately choose who we want to be, choosing to become more like himself if
that is what we want(.)" [(source)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/church-historians-press/at-the-pulpit/part-4/chapter-43?lang=eng)

As I believe that I cannot keep my children from growing up, from having to endure
puberty, starting a life of their own, etc., without destroying their futures, I also
believe that God could not prevent us from progressing either - that instead he embraces
progress, for "This is my work and my glory; to bring to pass the immortality and eternal
life of man."
[Moses 1:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng)

By this logic, it seems contrary to God's nature and ours, that we should ever be halted
in progressing toward His glory, so long as we follow Jesus' plan. There is ample proof
that this is only denied to those who fight his plan, who reject Jesus and upon whom the
blood of the prophets is found. All else "shall bow the knee, and every tongue shall
confess to him who sits upon the throne forever and
ever;" [D&C 76:110](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng)

### Thesis
**The journey to the Celestial Kingdom is the destiny of all mankind,
not just the proverbial "righteous". It is a function of time within eternity, and
eventual choice.**

# 2: Why is Salvation Even Needed?

### The Fall
A full description of the Fall of Adam, its effects and implications, and doctrine
around it doesn't really fall under the scope of what I'm studying here, but good
readings around it can be had in the following places:

* [Alma 12:22 - Alma 13:13](https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng)

* The Temple Ceremony, or summaries from [Endowed From on High by John D Charles](https://www.amazon.com/Endowed-High-Understanding-Symbols-Endowment/dp/0882906143)

* The opening books of Genesis

* [Moses 4-5](https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/4?lang=eng)

* [2 Nephi chapter 2](https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng)

#### Summary of the Fall of Adam
God said that if they ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they would die.
Further, by disobedience, they could no longer be in His presence in the Garden of
Eden. Whether this presence and constant communion with God is symbolized by
the Tree of Life and the Cherubim protecting it, or not is worth studying further, but
it would seem to fit a number of references to the Tree of Life nicely.

We are taught that two things were introduced as byproducts of the Fall of Adam and Eve.

1. Death
2. A separation of us from God's presence

God knew this could happen, and had planned to provide a Savior for us, to bring us
back into his presence.

## Jesus' Reconciliation Between us and the Father
Again, a full description of Jesus's role in all of this falls outside the scope of
this study.

A succinct description of Jesus' role can be had in [3 Nephi 27:]()

```
13 Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto
you— that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.

14 And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had
been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been
lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be
judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil—

15 And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the
Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.

16 And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be
filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father
at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.

17 And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast
into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.

18 And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause
he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his
words.

19 And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his
rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith,
and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.

20 Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be
baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye
may stand spotless before me at the last day.

21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must
do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that
which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do;

22 Therefore, if ye do these things blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted up at the last
day
```

## What Is Salvation
In broad terms, salvation is redemption from the Fall of Adam and Eve - **to be brought
back into the presence of God** the Eternal Father through the sufferings and merits
of Jesus Christ, and the terms and conditions set by Him, and Him alone. These were
revealed to Adam and Eve:

```
28 And after God had appointed that these things should come unto [Adam and Eve], behold,
then he saw that it was expedient that [they] should know concerning the things whereof he
had appointed unto them;

29 Therefore he sent angels to converse with [Adam and Eve], who caused [them] to behold
of his glory.

30 And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with
[Adam and Eve], and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared
from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their
faith and repentance and their holy works.

[...]

32 Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan
of redemption, that they should not do evil [...]

33 [And] God did call on [Adam and Eve], in the name of his Son, (this being the plan of
redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your hearts, then
will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;

34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on
mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter
into my [presence].

35 And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath
that he shall not enter into my [presence].
```

[Alma 12:28-33, context added](https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng)

As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, this is a particularly
relevant passage, since in the Endowment ceremony we are instructed to view the story
of Adam and Eve as though _we_ are Adam or Eve.

In essence, our journey, just like theirs, is to be brought back into God's presence.

## Jesus' Terms and Conditions
Jesus' teachings are pretty clear - follow Him.

How we follow Him has been the source of millenia of discussion, arguments, divisions,
and even wars.

Let me simplify it by stating that only Jesus can tell you how to follow Him. Your
answers are your own journey, and salvation is only attainable through revelation. When
Nephi asked his brothers if they had asked God for answers, they said He didn't talk
to them. Nephi responded with some pretty damning questions.

Ask God. When you think about it, it's ridiculous that you should put your
salvation in another person's hands and pass on your agency to someone else. "Come
unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and
trembling before him." [Phillipians 2:12-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/2?lang=eng)

# 3: Beyond Traditional Salvation - State Changes
## Common Paradigm of the Restored Church in the Early 21st Century
### Common Perceptions in the Church

As of 2023, I believe it is commonly taught that we were with God, we came here to gain
bodies and experience, and that when we die we go to either Spirit Prison or Spirit
Paradise, and finally after a Final Judgement, we go to one of three kingdoms of Glory.
Narrowing it down for time's sake - those who made covenants go to the Celestial, those
who didn't but were still good to the Terrestrial, and the unrighteous and unbelieving to
the Telestial.

My own dad taught this to us in 12 year old sunday school, again and again for months,
using the following diagram:

![](https://www.eternalroundring.com/uploads/1/2/1/2/121243642/description-2019-03-30-at-5-56-44-pm_orig.png)
`diagram a`

My position in this book is that we ought to largely rearrange the diagram along these
lines:

![](https://www.eternalroundring.com/uploads/1/2/1/2/121243642/linear-image-with-christ_orig.jpg)
`diagram b`

This goes against common perceptions in the church, but not against any actual
doctrine.

When studying any science, topic, hobby, or in this case, religious doctrine,
I give strong credence to Primary Sources. People or statements based in actual
experience, practice, learning, or revelation, in the case of religion. If something
is taught in Sunday School, over a pulpit, or anywhere else in church, I ask myself
where that information came from. Is it _actually_ truth, or just the philosophies of
men, mingled with scripture?

For example - when church standards for grooming were updated around the turn of the
century to discourage multiple ear piercings for women or getting tattoos, a lot of people
cited 1 Corinthians 6:19, stating that our bodies are temples, and that changing your
bodies was like defacing the temple.

Taken out of context, yes, that would seem to make sense, but taking the whole
scripture with its context, it's clear that it's referring to the body of Christ, of
which we are all members. In other words, this teaching is not based in truth, but is
just an anecdotal saying.

Yet again, I have seen people speak _over the pulpit at General Conference_, citing
Jesus' words in ST John 5:39 as reason to study scriptures:

```
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
testify of me.
```
[LeGrand Richards, 1980](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak?lang=eng&id=p2-p3#p2)

But the phrase "for in them ye think ye have eternal life" was mocking the pharisees,
and even damning them. Cited out of context, this scripture can sound like we get
closer to Jesus by reading scriptures, and while this is undoubtedly true, it's not
the whole truth.

The problem lies in that we repeat these secondary sources' words when teaching in
church, and do so out of context, creating a cloud of would-be-truths around the
actual truth, and obscure it.

Regarding "kingdoms of glory", I believe this has happened again and again, to the
point that we have accepted many philosophies of men and half-truths as being both
truth and canon.

### Context of Doctrine & Covenants 76
If I were to ask a typical well-read member of the church where we learn about
kingdoms of glory, they'll almost certainly cite D&C 76 as being the revelation where
Joseph Smith learned about the kingdoms of Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial glory.

In my recent studies, reading through 76 in the context of my thesis, I was shocked to
learn that section 76 says _nothing_ about kingdoms. The entirety of section 76 was given
in response to Joseph Smith and Sydney Rigdon's wonder at translating this piece of the
original King James text:

```
And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and 
they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
```

To this newly translated piece:

```
And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; 
and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

It is entirely possible that the glories described in 76 are present in the Spirit
World, rather than simply Spirit Prison and Spirit Paradise.

In fact, the terms "Spirit Paradise" and "Spirit Prison" are not derived from scriptural
sources, and cannot be traced easily. Possibly to Joseph F Smith's vision in D&C 138? But
for the sake of our arguments, we will simply suspend their existence as non-doctrinal
for the time being, and that any reference to them is a Secondary Source and anecdotal.

### Resurrections and Glories - not Kingdoms

D&C 76:50+ states that the resurrection of the just has all those who received the
priesthood (Temple ordinances). It further describes those of the church of the firstborn,
those who stayed faithful, those who are celestial - first resurrection.

v70: `These are they whose bodies are celestial`

[D&C 76:50-70](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p50-p70#p50)

After that, we get a description of those who are Terrestrial. Note that it is a
description - as of verse 80 we don't have anything about which resurrection, nor that
their bodies are even resurrected in this state.

Telestial persons are
```
not redeemed from the devil until the last resurrection, 
until the Lord, even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work`.

86 These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy
Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial;

87 And the terrestrial through the ministration of the celestial.

88 And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to
minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them; for they shall
be heirs of salvation.
```
[D&C 76:81-85](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p50-p70#p50)

But what is the `eternal world` in v86? The spirit world? The resurrected world? As of
v88, this question remains unanswered.

Of special note, v88 states that the telestial beings receive the Holy Ghost through
messengers sent to a telestial world. Thinking again of the spirits in "prison", Jesus
did not minister to the damned during his 3 days in the Spirit World, but sent "angels"
(think Peter, James and John) to the damned to preach the gospel.

```
29 [...] I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient 
who had rejected the truth [...];

30 But [...] among the righteous, he [...] appointed messengers, [..] and commissioned 
them to go forth [...] to them that were in darkness [...]

31 And the chosen messengers went forth [...] to the captives who were bound, even unto
all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.
```
[D&C 138:29-31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng)

D&C 130 states that what we attain to in this life gives us the more advantage - or in
King Follet Sermon terms - a higher rung in the ladder, a rung that will be filled
later by people they help up.

[D&C 130:18-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p18-p21#p18)
[King Follett Sermon Part 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1971/04/the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19)

Heralding back to the original question that Sydney Rigdon and Joseph Smith found
while translating the Bible and consequently spurring this vision into existence:

```
17 And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and
they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

At no time does it say that we are resurrected to these states, merely which groups
shall have part in the first resurrection (of the just) and those of the second
resurrection (of the unjust).

The King Follet sermon concludes with words of rejoicing, indicating that those who
have passed on the faith, are in celestial glory:

``` 
...and those who have died in the faith are now in the celestial kingdom of God. And 
hence is the glory of the sun.

You mourners have occasion to rejoice, speaking of the death of Elder King Follett; for
your husband and father is gone to wait until the resurrection of the dead—until the
perfection of the remainder; for at the resurrection your friend will rise in perfect
felicity and go to celestial glory, while many must wait myriads of years before they can
receive the like blessings; and your expectations and hopes are far above what man can
conceive; for why has God revealed it to us?
```

If an unresurrected can be in the celestial kingdom of God, what, when, and where is
the Celestial Kingdom of God? What about Final Judgement? Is not that supposed to
divide us into kingdoms, _after_ being resurrected?

Referring to `Diagram a`, which is commonly perceived as correct within the church, this
certainly does not fit.

Let me describe a narrative that fits the concepts of degrees of glory outside the
context of mortality, a two-sided spirit world, or of resurrection.
