# Resurrection, the Kingdoms of Glory, and Work for the Dead/Sinners

## Hypothesis

All men are saved eventually - the Second Resurrection allows for all those except who
have committed the unpardonable sin (D&C 130: 27), to have an opportunity to attain
the celestial kingdom.

## Agenda

## Body

### Those who transgress, after being sealed by the spirit of promise, are still saved, even if they have to rise in the second resurrection

D&C 130:19

```
And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which
is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy
Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the
keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them—Ye shall come forth in the first
resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and
shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and
depths—then shall it be written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder
whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder
whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my
servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force
when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are
set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their
heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.
```

Reworded: If two people are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise and by a Sealer, they
will either come forth in the first or second resurrection, and inherit
[sealing blessings], if you commit no murder/don't stone the prophets.

Verse 26 further clarifies

```
26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they
are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she
shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and
all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder wherein they shed innocent blood,
yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but
they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan
unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.
```

Takeaways: People can leave the church and still be saved. It will just be in the
second resurrection - the resurrection of the unjust and sinners.

D&C 76:50+ states that the resurrection of the just has all those who recieved the
priesthood (Temple ordinances)

Describes those of the church of the firstborn, those who stayed faithful, those who
are celestial - first resurrection.

70: `These are they whose bodies are celestial`

After that, we get a description of those who are Terrestrial. Note that it is a
description - as of verse 80 we don't have anything about which resurrection, nor that
their bodies are even resurrected in this state.

85: Telestial persons are not redeemed `until the last resurrection, until the Lord,
even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work`.

```
86 These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy
Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial;

87 And the terrestrial through the ministration of the celestial.

88 And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to
minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them; for they shall
be heirs of salvation.
```

But what is the `eternal world`? The spirit world? The resurrected world? As of v88,
this question remains unanswered.

Also of note: Jesus did not minister to the damned, but sent "angels" (think Peter,
James and John) to the damned to preach the gospel (D&C 138:29-31)

D&C 130 states that what we attain to in this life gives us the more advantage - or in
King Follet Sermon terms - a higher rung in the ladder, a rung that will be filled
later by people they help up.

From D&C 130:

```
15 For while we were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us,
we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as
follows—

16 Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall hear the voice of
the Son of Man:

17 And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and
they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

At no time does it say that we are resurrected to these states, merely which groups
shall have part in the first resurrection (of the just) and those of the second
resurrection (of the unjust).

The King Follet sermon concludes with words of rejoicing, indicating that those who
are passed in the faith, are in celestial glory:

``` 
...and those who have died in the faith are now in the celestial kingdom of God. And 
hence is the glory of the sun.

You mourners have occasion to rejoice, speaking of the death of Elder King Follett; for
your husband and father is gone to wait until the resurrection of the dead—until the
perfection of the remainder; for at the resurrection your friend will rise in perfect
felicity and go to celestial glory, while many must wait myriads of years before they can
receive the like blessings; and your expectations and hopes are far above what man can
conceive; for why has God revealed it to us?
```

The entirety of of section 76 was given in response to their wonder at translating this:

```
29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
```

To this:

```
And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.
```

Namely, that those who did not repent in this life will pay prices for their sins, but
ultimately be saved and brought forth in the second resurrection.
